The examples of this branch were developed with `Java 9` and shows you how to modularize `Vert.x applications`, manage third-party dependencies, compile, package in a modular jar, and how to test them. You can be found `Java 8` version of this repository in [java8 branch.](https://github.com/hakdogan/IntroduceToEclicpseVert.x/tree/java8)
